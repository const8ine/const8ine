### About Me

- Transhumanist and longevity activist
- I have more then seven years of experience as a Fullstack/Frontend Engineer (MEAN)
- My priority is contributing to the biology of aging and longevity science

I'm developing and maintaining **Open Genes**, an open-source, non-commercial biological database of human genes associated with aging and lifespan. After our publication in the *Nucleic Acids Research* journal, Open Genes has received recognition from the scientific community and notable scientists in this field.
